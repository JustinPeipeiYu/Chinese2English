# PURPOSE
This desktop program takes input text in Chinese and translates to English. It can used to derive the meaning of short sentences and phrases written in Chinese. Alternatively, it can be used for basic Chinese writing. Thus, this program may be a useful tool for beginning Chinese learners. 

# FEATURES
The program consists of a single form that supports input for both pinyin (the intermediary phonetic representation of Chinese) and hanzi (the character representation). The form makes use of an on-screen keyboard which the user can build the pinyin from scratch. Alternatively, the user's mouse can be a pen on the character pad, and the user can write the hanzi. The word options are automatically displayed when there is a match. Clicking on the option or clicking the corresponding number on keyboard will add it to the labels at the top of the form. Translation is automatically generated as words are added to the labels. Pinyin, Hanzi, and English phrases can be copied from the labels to user's clipboard for pasting in other applications.
